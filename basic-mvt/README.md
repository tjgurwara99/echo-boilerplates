# Basic Model View Template boilerplate code for echo web applications

## Features include

1. `github.com/a-h/templ` templating library
2. `tailwind` css for styling the basic templates - taken from the free samples provided in tailwindui.com (if there are licensing issues I will remove these and use some basic forms and pages instead)
3. Echo
4. SQLite for database and session storage - easily replaceable to other databases
5. GORM
